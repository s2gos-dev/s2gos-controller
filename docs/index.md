The _Digital Twin Earth Synthetic Scene Generator and Observation Simulator_ 
(DTE-S2GOS) project consists in the development of a new component of the 
[ESA Destination Earth Initiative](https://destination-earth.eu/) 
to be implemented in the [ESA DestinE Platform](https://platform.destine.eu/) 
as a pre-operational service. The primary objective of DTE-S2GOS is to develop a 
comprehensive and accurate simulation framework that can generate physically 
realistic synthetic 3D scenes of the Earth and simulate ground-based or spaceborne 
remote sensing observations, among other with the 
[Eradiate Radiative Transfer Model](https://github.com/eradiate/eradiate).

**Note, this project and its documentation is still in an early development stage.**
